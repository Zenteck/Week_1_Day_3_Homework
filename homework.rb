# Complete these tasks:
#
#     Add "Edinburgh Waverley" to the end of the array
# p stops.push("Edinburgh Waverley")
# #     Add "Glasgow Queen St" to the start of the array
# p stops.unshift("Glasgow Queen Street")
# #     Add "Polmont" at the appropriate point (between "Falkirk High" and "Linlithgow")
# p stops.insert(4, "Polmont")
# #     Work out the index position of "Linlithgow"
# p stops.index("Linlithgow")
# #     Remove "Livingston" from the array using its name
# p stops.delete("Livingston")
# #     Delete "Cumbernauld" from the array by index
# p stops.delete_at(1)
#     How many stops there are in the array?
# p stops.count()
#     How many ways can we return "Falkirk High" from the array?
# return stops.values_at(2)
# return stops[2]
#     Reverse the positions of the stops in the array
# p stops.reverse
#     Print out all the stops using a for loop
# for places in stops
#   p places
